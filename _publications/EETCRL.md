Abstract:
This paper proposes a simple Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) framework that considers the entity types. The KGE finds appropriate representations of entities and relations by learning structured information in triples and uses these representations to predict the missing links in a knowledge graph (KG). The entity types are included in many KGs, but most of the existing methods ignored its potential for the link prediction task. The proposed framework, which is called EETCRL (Entity and Entity Type Composition Representation Learning), learns representations for entities and entity types in a simple way. Those combined representations are used for link prediction. The proposed framework is evaluated on three datasets and the results show that while the overall performance was comparable to baseline methods, its performance depends on the entity type. This paper also discusses how the information about entity types affects the link prediction through analysis of the fine-grained results.
